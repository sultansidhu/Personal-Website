                    It hasn't been long since I was introduced to computer science - I never took it in school. However, going to university I did not have a clear direction to pursue, so I decided to go with it. It was love at first sight (or well, first print statement). My journey so far has been a rocky road, but hard work, determination, coffee, and an occasional game of billiards have allowed me to succeed both inside and outside the classroom.

                    Driven by a passion for Artificial Intelligence and Software Development, I place great emphasis on delivering quality results even in the most gruelling and strict environments.
